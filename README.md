# AWS Project 4: Security Group and NACL Challenge

## 📌 Overview
This challenge focused on understanding and applying network security in AWS by configuring Security Groups and Network ACLs (NACLs) to control traffic between EC2 instances. The goal was to test, block, and allow traffic based on specific protocols and port ranges.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Amazon EC2
- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- Security Groups
- Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)
- Ping & SSH testing

## ✅ Key Tasks Completed
- Created a custom VPC and custom Security Groups to allow and block specific inbound and outbound traffic
- Configured NACLs to restrict and permit traffic by protocol and port
- Tested connectivity using ping, SSH, and web traffic to validate configurations
- Diagnosed and resolved access issues by analyzing layered security controls

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Differences between stateful (Security Groups) and stateless (NACLs) firewalls
- How layered security policies interact and affect accessibility
- Importance of direction (inbound vs. outbound) in network rule configuration

## 🔗 Outcome
Successfully demonstrated layered network security principles and verified correct access behavior by configuring Security Groups and NACLs for EC2 instances.
